## Configurator
[surveyloader.org/configurator](http://surveyloader.org/configurator/)

The configurator provides a GUI front end to create survey configurations that conform to the JSON configuration format. Additionally it handles authentication for saving and modifying configurations hosted on the surveyloader [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/rest/api/). For Firebase write privileges you must request access for your github account from the surveyloader administrator, [@rstrom](https://github.com/rstrom).
