The Triple module solicits pairwise preferences between three aspects A, B and C. It provides one scenario between A vs. B, A vs. C, B vs. A, B vs. C, C vs. A and C vs. B (these pairs can be modified with the `aspect_pairs` parameter refering to each aspect with 0-indexing). Each scenario independently draws a random increase/decrease in the range 1-8. The range can be specified with the parameter `tradeoff_range`. If the parameter `tradeoff_sign` is set to -1 the module will present decreasing scenarios.

**NB:** By default aspect texts, ratings and colors are pulled from the table, e.g. as `$rating_$(aspect_a_0)`. The Bucket module will produce aspects texts and colors which conform to the `aspect_a_0` schema. Similarly the Rating module will provide rating values that conform to the `$rating_$(aspect_a_0)` schema. Bucket and Rating are prerequisite dependencies for Triple in the module queue, unless you manually specify its parameters in the survey configuration.
