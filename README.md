# Survey Loader
These are a set of tools for configuring, running, testing and simulating adaptive surveys.

The tools center around a ReactJS-based survey module loader. The loader exposes survey module parameters and environment variables from a declarative survey format. For full documentation take a look at [surveyloader.org/docs](http://surveyloader.org/docs/).
